Node JS
========

Node JS is 
- a cross platform 
- open source JavaScript run time enviornment
- can run on windows, macOS, Linux, Unix and more
- runs on V8 JavaScript Engine
- executes JavaScript code outside a web browser


- Node JS is a javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine
- Maintained by open JS Foundation
- Node JS Features an event driven architecture and supports asynchronous I/O (non-blocking I/O).

- Node JS was built by Ryan Dual in 2009.
- Ryan started with the Spider-Monkey JS engine, which is found on Firefox. but in two days he tried using v8 and newer looked back.
- Earlier, Ryan was working independently, but there was a company named Joyent, and this company was working on something similar to NodeJS and they hire Ryan to work under us, we will fund your project. big contribution to Joyent Company.
- The earlier name of Node.js was Web.js, but Ryan Dahl later renamed it to Node.js because it was intended to be used for more than just web servers.
- Apache HTTP Server was a blocking server, so Ryan wanted to create a non-blocking server, which is why Node.js is a non-blocking I/O. The advantage of a non-blocking server is that it can handle multiple requests with a smaller number of threads.
- In 2010, NPM (Node Package Manager) was introduced. NPM is a package manager for Node.js, and it played a critical role in the success of Node.js
- Initially, Node.js was built only for macOS and Linux, but in 2011, it gained support for Microsoft Windows as well.
- In 2012, Isaac Z.Schlueter began maintaining Node.js, he is also the creator of NPM
- In 2012, a developer named Fedor created a fork of Node.js called io.js, which led to controversy within the company. As a result, 3 to 4 developers began maintaing the io.js branch.
- In September 2015, Node.js and io.js were merged, and the combined project was named the Node.js Foundation.
- In 2019, the JS Foundation and the Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJsFoundation, which now maintains Node.js
